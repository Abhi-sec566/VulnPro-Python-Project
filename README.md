### ✅ Tips to Enhance the “Hacker Vibe” Further:
- Add a **banner** in `vulnpro.py` using ASCII art (with `pyfiglet` or custom).
- Use `rich` or `termcolor` for improved console visuals.
- Create a demo GIF or screenshot and embed it in the README.
- Add a cool tagline like:
  > _"Recon, fuzz, pwn — all in one script."_ 💥

Let me know if you want help generating ASCII banners or creating a release.
